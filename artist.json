(Like Monopoly)\n\nThen one foggy Christmas Eve\nSanta came to say(That he did):\n\"Rudolph with your nose so bright\nWon't you guide my sleigh tonight?\"\nThen how the reindeer loved him (Loved him)\nAs they shouted out with glee, (Yipee!)\n\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,(Reindeer\nYou'll go down in history.\"(Like George Washington)\nHe had a really really really big nose\nHey look it even glows\nDon't call him names\nJust join in the Reindeer games\nYou might also likeThen on foggy Christmas Eve\nSanta came to say,(We know now)\n\"Rudolph with your nose so bright\nWon't you guide my sleigh tonight?\"(Rudolph, Rudolph your the best)\nAs they shouted out with glee, (Yipee!)\n\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\nYou'll go down in history.\"Embed"

How do you lie? How do you lie?)\nOh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, silly little thrill\nCan't figure out just how you do it and we know I never will\nWent for me and not her\n'Cause girls your age know better\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI've made some real big mistakes\nBut you make the worst one look fine\nI should've known it was strange\nYou only come out at night\nI used to think I was smart\nBut you made me look so naive\nThe way you sold it for parts\nAs you sunk your teeth into me, oh\nBloodsucker, dream crusher\nBleedin' me dry like a real life vampire\n\n[Bridge]\n(Ooh)\nYou said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?\nYou can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart\nI tried to help you out, now I know that I can't\n'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand\n\n[Chorus]\nI've made some real big mistakes\nBut you make the worst one look fine\nI should've known it was strange\nYou only come out at night\nI used to think I was smart\nBut you made me look so naive\nThe way you sold it for parts\nAs you sunk your teeth into me, oh\nBloodsucker, dream crusher\nBleedin' me dry like a real life vampireEmbed"
